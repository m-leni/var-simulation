## Testing Steps Before Merge

### 1. Local Testing

```bash
# Clean environment
rm -rf .pytest_cache htmlcov .coverage

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

# Run all tests
pytest -v

# Check coverage
pytest --cov=src --cov=main --cov-report=term-missing

# Run linters
flake8 src/ main.py --max-line-length=120
black --check src/ main.py --line-length=120
isort --check-only src/ main.py

# Security scan
bandit -r src/ main.py -ll
```

### 2. Verify GitHub Actions

- [ ] Push to test branch
- [ ] Check GitHub Actions tab for workflow execution
- [ ] Verify all jobs pass (test, lint, security)
- [ ] Review coverage reports
- [ ] Check for any warnings or issues

### 3. Code Review

- [ ] Review all test files for quality
- [ ] Ensure tests are independent
- [ ] Verify mocks are used correctly
- [ ] Check test naming conventions
- [ ] Validate assertion messages
- [ ] Review fixture usage

### 4. Documentation Review

- [ ] All documentation is accurate
- [ ] Examples work correctly
- [ ] Links are not broken
- [ ] Instructions are clear
- [ ] Coverage goals are documented

## Post-Merge Tasks

### Immediate (Within 1 Day)

- [ ] Verify CI/CD runs on main branch
- [ ] Check coverage reports are generated
- [ ] Confirm badges are updated (if using)
- [ ] Notify team of test suite availability
- [ ] Update project board/tracking

### Short Term (Within 1 Week)

- [ ] Set up pre-commit hooks for team
- [ ] Configure IDE test runners
- [ ] Create test writing guidelines
- [ ] Schedule test review meeting
- [ ] Document common test patterns

### Medium Term (Within 1 Month)

- [ ] Achieve 80%+ overall coverage
- [ ] Add integration tests
- [ ] Implement E2E tests for critical paths
- [ ] Set up test performance monitoring
- [ ] Create test maintenance schedule

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise after merge:

1. **Minor Issues**
   - Fix forward with hot fix PR
   - Update documentation as needed
   
2. **Major Issues**
   - Revert merge commit
   - Fix issues on feature branch
   - Re-test thoroughly
   - Attempt merge again

## Success Criteria

The test suite is ready for production when:

- âœ… All tests pass consistently
- âœ… Coverage >= 80% overall
- âœ… CI/CD pipeline runs successfully
- âœ… No critical security issues
- âœ… Documentation is complete
- âœ… Team has been trained on usage
- âœ… Tests run in < 5 minutes
- âœ… No flaky tests

## Known Limitations

Document any known limitations:

1. **Streamlit Testing**: Basic tests only, full UI testing requires additional setup
2. **External APIs**: All external calls are mocked, integration tests needed for real API testing
3. **Performance Tests**: Not included in initial suite
4. **Load Tests**: Not included, should be added for API endpoints
5. **Visual Tests**: Plot/chart testing not implemented

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements:

- [ ] Increase Streamlit test coverage
- [ ] Add property-based testing with Hypothesis
- [ ] Implement mutation testing
- [ ] Add performance benchmarks
- [ ] Create visual regression tests
- [ ] Set up test data factories
- [ ] Add contract tests for APIs
- [ ] Implement snapshot testing
